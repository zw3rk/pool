    zw3rk operated pools
    ====================
    
    ZW3RK pool
    ~~~~~
    The ZW3RK pool is operated to fund Continuous Integration servers for GHC and other Haskell projects.
    The fixed fee is 340, and the margin 1%, with the hope to cover the costs for running Linux, macOS,
    and hopefully soon Windows and *BSD CI servers.
    
    We currently provide:
    - 3 x x86_64-linux
    - 1 x aarch64-linux
    - 1 x aarch64-darwin
    
    The ZW3RK pool should generate competitive rewards, while funding the server and operation of GHC
    Continuous Integration.

    HASK pool
    ~~~~
    The HASK pool is operated to fund produce continuous funding for the Haskell Foundation. 
    The fixed fee is 340, margin 1%, 9% retention and 90% funding.
    
    This pool will *not* earn stakers any rewards, all rewards will be collected. 9% of the
    collected rewards go towards building an endowment, and 90% of the rewards will be donated
    to the Haskell Foundation on an interval that still needs to be determined.
